			<h2>User feedback revision - 3/8</h2>
			<p>Commentary on the revision based on user feedback will be split into three sections:</p>
			<h3>Tangible changes</h3>
			<p>Because there was not a lot of content (and because the available content was effectively placeholder), not too much was changed.
			The lighter background color was adjusted to be a little less bright, and the wording for the intro screen was changed a little (again
			not too significant because it is all subject to change).</p>
			<h3>Conceptual changes</h3>
			<p>One of my goals for the user feedback was to find out where the project lied on the spectrums of educational and fun. The feedback
			unanimously agreed there was a lot of potential for learning, and that even in the small snippet that I showed they learned something.
			For the fun side, there needs to be more engagement whether it comes in the form of pictures, graphics, sound, or effects.</p>
			<h3>Future changes</h3>
			<p>Most of the feedback was directed towards the future state of the project. Users stated that it was important that the game stay
			realistic and accurate to real life as it continued to be developed. They also stated that they didn't think adding a lot more features
			would be too complex. I obtained perspectives from immigrants themselves that they would want to be shared indirectly through the game.
			Future iterations of the intro screen should go more in depth, giving more background on both the industry and the backstory of the
			character.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>User feedback interviews - 3/1</h2>
			<p>
				My first iteration can be found <a href="https://elision.surge.sh">here</a>.
			</p>
			<h3>Questions (abbreviated, full questions can be found by clicking the link):</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Does the info screen give you enough of a background to start the game?
					<p>The screen has two sections: one introducing the premise of the smuggling industry and one introducing the premise of the game.
					While the two section idea is good, both need elaborating on. (E.g. what does smuggling really mean, what does it involve?) Also,
					the backstory of the character should be fleshed out more.</p>
				</li>
				<li>At what points while playing the game did you think it was too complicated? Too simple?
					<p>At the state it was presented, it was not too complicated. Testers were excited for more things to be added. The game in its 
					current form provides interesting dilemnas without being too confusing.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Did you think the user interface was easy to use? Would you change anything about it?
					<p>User interface looked fine - maybe button text can be changed for clarity. The light tan background is a little distracting, can look
					into a less saturated / darker color.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Can a game do a complex topic justice?
					<p>From the perspective of gamers, yes. The gamers have all played games that have tackled serious issues like mental health and
					societal identity - they think it definitely can be done well. One particular feedback was that games are the best way to teach
					because they put you into a world where you can indirectly learn and realize things on your own. They said that this game shows 
					potential and that this game can do a complex topic justice as long as it is accurate. An example was brought up about how many
					modern armies, corporations, and institutions use games or gamified systems to teach already.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Was this game fun? Educational?
					<p>It can definitely be educational - in terms of being more engaging, there needs to be some more visuals, effects, sounds, etc.</p>
				</li>
				<li>From your experience with immigration, what part of your experience do you think should be told?
					<p>One respondent said that they wanted to highlight the ineffeciencies of the governments in countries with high migrancy rates -
						smuggling wouldn't be so prevalent if it didn't take years to get a single passport checked.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Changes to next version</h3>
			<p>The biggest takeaway for me is that the project is on a good track currently, and would skew to the informative side rather than the
			engaging side. Going forwards, I will focus most of my effort to simply creating more content, and to make sure that any produced content
			is accurate and representative. I will start to think about how to increase the complexity of the game as well, and to make priority lists
			for what to do next.</p>
